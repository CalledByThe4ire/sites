Welcome to Essential React! In this course we’ll cover all of the essential knowledge you need to have about React components. We’ll state easy! We’re going to start with `Hello World!` and JSX. How to get started and what they are. But we’re going to progress pretty quickly to events. and state, and state management, lifecycle events, and get all the way to advanced composition of components. Yes! Advanced composition. But don’t be afraid, I think you can handle it. We’re going to take it one step at a time. Only one new concept per video. The whole thing will take about fourty to fourty-five minutes, but by the end you’ll know everything that you need to know to write stellar React apps. We’ll build this Pokemon component that allows you to page through all of the Pokemon available on Pokeapi.co. It’s going to be a lot of fun! Let’s get started.
