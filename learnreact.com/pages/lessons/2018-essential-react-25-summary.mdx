Thank you so much for taking this course on `Essential React`. We started with `Hello World`, and `JSX`, and getting a project started. Covered events, `state`, state management with the object in functional form of `setState`, knowing and unknowing components, and all of its various names, and made our way all the way to composition with component props, render props, and higher-order components. From here, you should have a pretty good grasp of how React components work. I’ve covered all of the essentials, but I’m sure you have a lot of questions left. Please check out some of the other courses. I’m always making more, and they should help clarify a few things for you. Thanks again!
