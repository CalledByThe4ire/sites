# DevTools

Have you been punched in the face for asking a question?

I have  
I asked "can I customize my DevTools?" and Chrome's documentation reached out from one my Mac's free USB A hubs to clock me in the jaw

Google, you're smart â€” WE GET IT  
Maybe I'll be smart some day and care more about accuracy than being helpful  
But TODAY, I don't know shit and I just want someone to show me _exactly_ how to do a thing.

If you want the same,  
Here are the bloodied notes I took while getting pummeled by the Extending DevTools documentation

## Starting

Create an empty `manifest.json` wherever you'd like to build your extension

Navigate to `chrome://extensions/` in Chrome

Enable `Developer mode`

Click the (now visible) `Load unpacked` button

Select the folder containing your `manifest.json` in the file picker

This will fail  
You'll get four errors  
Fix them in order

`Manifest is not valid JSON. Line: 1, column: 1, Unexpected token.`

- Add curly braces to `manifest.json` and make it valid
- Hit `Retry` in Chrome

`The 'manifest_version' key must be present and set to 2 (without quotes). See developer.chrome.com/extensions/manifestVersion.html for details.`

- Do precisely what it says (`"manifest_version": 2`)
- Hit `Retry` in Chrome

`Required value 'name' is missing or invalid.`

- Add a `name` field calling it whatever you want (`"name": "Clever Extension Name"`)
- You can rename it whenever
- Hit `Retry` in Chrome

`Required value 'version' is missing or invalid. It must be between 1-4 dot-separated integers each between 0 and 65536.`

- Add `version` according to the spec. I start with `"version": "0.0.1"`
- Hit `Retry` in Chrome

Success!  
You should now see your extension loaded

What does your `manifest.json` look like?  
Mine looks like this:

```
{
  "name": "Clever Extension Name",
  "manifest_version": 2,
  "version": "0.0.1"
}
```

### Why did you make me see all the errors?

Because you're gonna have to get used depending on this page for errors  
It's the only place you're likely to see them as you develop
